# Super-Shape-Bros
funny smash bros inspired game im working on

Controls:
p1 uses wsad to move, v to light attack and b to uppercut.
p2 uses arrows to move, num pad 2 to light attack and numpad 1 to uppercut. (sorry if you dont have a numpad i will probebly fix this in the future)

When in the menu you can use the arrows to the left of the play button to control the amount of lives you start with. (if its set to -1 lives will be infinite)
