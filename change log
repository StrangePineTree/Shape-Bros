decided to make a change log cuz why not (might forget some stuff or not update this)

9/23:
Changed the name of the game to 'Super Shape Bros'
attacks now move with the player that made them rather than being a static hazard
light attack now has a cooldown
player 2 is now a circle instead of a square (will eventually add different shapes to choose from that have different abilities)
changed how main platform collision works
when above 3 lives a counter shows extra lives
alt+f4/top right x now close the game instead of using the BFG attack
